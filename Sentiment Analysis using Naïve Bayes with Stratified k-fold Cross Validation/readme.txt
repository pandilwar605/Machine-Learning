The code contains only one file naive_bayes.py and the 3 data files.
code can be run by using following command:
python naive_bayes.py filename.txt

Program will generate graphs for both the experiments based on filename given.

For this code, i am setting k-fold value as 10 by default as mentioned in assignment(pp1.pdf). Also, value of smoothing factor is hard coded based on the experiment.

No library like numpy and panda is used anywhere in code for data handling,pre-processing and transformation.

Please refer to the report for more details
